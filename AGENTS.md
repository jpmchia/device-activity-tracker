# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains the TypeScript backend and CLI (`tracker.ts`, `signal-tracker.ts`, `server.ts`, `index.ts`).
- `client/` contains the React web UI (Create React App + Tailwind). Client tests live in `client/src/`.
- `dist/` is the TypeScript build output (generated by `pnpm run build`).
- `auth_info_baileys/` is created at runtime for WhatsApp auth state and must never be committed.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm install` installs root deps and runs `client` install via `postinstall`.
- `pnpm run build` compiles the backend to `dist/`.
- `pnpm start` runs the CLI tracker (`src/index.ts`).
- `pnpm run start:server` starts Signal init then the API server (`src/server.ts`).
- `pnpm run start:client` starts the React dev server (`client` on `http://localhost:3000`).
- `pnpm run dev` is an alias for `start:server`.
- `cd client && pnpm test` runs React tests (watch mode via `react-scripts`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use TypeScript in the backend and React/TS in `client/`.
- Indentation is 4 spaces in backend files; follow existing file style in each module.
- Keep filenames descriptive and aligned with existing modules (e.g., `signal-tracker.ts`).
- No dedicated formatter or linter is configured beyond CRA’s default ESLint rules in `client/`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Frontend tests use React Testing Library + Jest via `react-scripts`.
- Test files follow CRA conventions (e.g., `client/src/App.test.tsx`).
- There are currently no backend tests; add new tests alongside the module they cover.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Git history follows Conventional Commit-style prefixes such as `feat:` and `fix:`; use the same pattern for new commits.
- Keep PRs small and focused, with a short description and motivation (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Link related issues when applicable and note any changes to user-facing behavior (CLI or UI).
- Do not include credentials, session data, or `auth_info_baileys/` artifacts.
